# Welcome to our quantum tutorials

In today’s world, the word “quantum” evokes similar dreams, hopes and reactions like the words “blockchain” or “artificial intelligence”. Enthusiasts focus exclusively on the disruptive potential. The greater public sees it mostly as a big hype which is impossible to understand for normal people. This hipster role is rather new to the quantum sector. It has largely evolved under the radar to the greater public for the last one hundred years. In our tutorials on quantum technologies we would like to provide our readers with material to parse the news, get started with their own algorithms or simply extend their horizon.
