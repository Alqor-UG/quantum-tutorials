# Course summary for introduction to quantum technologies
The hipster role is rather new to the quantum sector which has largely evolved under the radar to the greater public for the last one hundred years. To bring this into context, we will summarize some basic concepts of quantum physics and thenÂ  discuss the four pillars of quantum technologies. Finishing this series of tutorials, will provide you a better background on large government programs like the European flagship on quantum technologies.

## Requirements

The whole course will be conducted without the need of any math or programming skills. We therefore think that it should be the most accessible to the broader public.
