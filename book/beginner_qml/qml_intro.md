# Course summary for a beginners guide to QML
Classical machine learning has changed the internet in a dramatic fashion. Because of this, researchers put a substantial effort into the develop of quantum machine learning.  In this series of tutorials on quantum technologies, we provide a basic introduction into some of the fundamental concepts behind supervised quantum machine learning algorithms. 

## Requirements

Knowledge of basic notions of quantum computing is assumed.

We provide the programming examples in `qiskit`.

- So if both things are known to you, you can directly start out. Otherwise, the introductory chapters of the qiskit textbook might be a great starting point.
- Knowledge of classical supervised learning is not really necessary, but certainly helpful. The Coursera course by deeplearning.ai is awesome.
